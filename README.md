# Employee_Attriction_Project
## Internship Final Project
Employee attrition is defined as the natural process by which employees leave the workforce – for example, through resignation for personal reasons or retirement – and are not immediately replaced.

Employee attrition occurs when the size of your workforce diminishes over time due to unavoidable factors such as employee resignation for personal or professional reasons.

Employees are leaving the workforce faster than they are hired, and it is often outside the employer’s control. For example, let’s say that you have opened a new office designated as the Sales Hub for your company. Every salesperson must work out of this office – but a few employees cannot relocate and choose to leave the company. This is a typical reason for employee attrition.

But there are other reasons for attrition as well, including the lack of professional growth, a hostile work environment, or declining confidence in the company’s market value. Weak leadership is another factor that often drives attrition among employees.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to predict the attrition rate for each employee, to find out who’s more likely to leave the organization.
It will help organizations to find ways to prevent attrition or to plan in advance the hiring of new candidate.
