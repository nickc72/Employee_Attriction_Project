# Employee_Attriction_Project
Internship Final Project
Employee attrition is defined as the natural process by which employees leave the workforce – for example, through resignation for personal reasons or retirement – and are not immediately replaced.
Employee attrition occurs when the size of your workforce diminishes over time due to unavoidable factors such as employee resignation for personal or professional reasons.
